                            <p>Peter is a 26 years old man. He wants to make sure he has a financial safety net. He sets
                                aside a small portion of his monthly income in a home safe. His savings grow, but still
                                he
                                loses about 5% of his money to inflation each year.</p>

                                interest on the deposit does not even cover inflation, and his money depreciates only
                                slightly slower than Peter's.</p>
